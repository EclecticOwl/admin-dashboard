# admin-dashboard

## Based off of the Odin Project

Project is mainly built with HTML and SASS

I decided to use a combination of both flexbox and grid layout for the page. 

This was a bit of a tougher challenge with CSS, especially when using SASS. However, it definitely
was useful to be able to nest and add variables to my CSS.
